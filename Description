# Processing-Microarray-Data
This package is dependent upon using the LUMI Bioconductor package to reprocess Illumina Microarray files.  
It also integrates Affymetrix files, which were processed seperately.  I pulled the files from GEO and re normalized 
them manually.  You could also perform this using your own Illumina files. I used the in Silico DB package to merge
files.  More information about this program can be found at https://insilicodb.com/.  It is improtant to note that 
this package requires some similiarity to merge array files.  If you are working with arrays from the same platform
the probe id will not need to be changed. I converted all of the probe ids to genes.  I removed all probes that 
did not match to genes, and collapsed redudant probes by the gene mean.  This leads to loss of data in arrays, so should
only be performed as necessary.
